  Explore the future of autonomous flight with a The OCaml Ground Control Station Flight Simulator 
  (OGCS) built in OCaml! This platform brings mission planning, real-time telemetry, and physics-based 
  simulation together in a seamless user experience. From precise waypoint plotting on an interactive map 
  to a 2D visualization of flight path, users can simulate real-world scenarios and test mission 
  strategiesâ€”all with the reliability and elegance of functional programming. 
  Whether you are a researcher, developer, or autonomous flight enthusiast, this tool offers a unique 
  look at cutting-edge aerial autonomy in a clean, immersive environment.
